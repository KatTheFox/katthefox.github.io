      <li>
        <a href="github.com/KatTheFox/The-Wheel">The Wheel</a>: A modern time
        control mod for Cultist Simulator. Adjust the fast-forward speed between
        0.2x and 32x, skip forward in time with keybinds, play the game entirely
        paused with skip-to-event keys, and more.

        <a href="github.com/KatTheFox/hawthorn">Hawthorn</a>: A Shelf mod for
        Cultist Simulator, aimed at adding compatibility with Shelves and most
        major content mods. Also includes a set of opinionated vanilla shelves,
        as well as requests from the community.
